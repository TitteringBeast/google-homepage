A project set by **The Odin Project**, with the objective of deconstructing an pre-existing webpage and rebuilding it. This is to give myself some experience setting up a webpage and get a better idea of how they should be set up and styled.

###What I learnt

#####Centering is hard

It was difficult structuring the pages how I wanted them to. Many things did not go according to plan - centering things was a particular headache, and a headache I'm sure I'll encounter frequently until I master it.

I learnt a lot about this, such as ensuring I have a width or max-width property on things I want centered, solidifying padding, margin and border knowledge. Basic stuff, I'm sure, but actually understanding these things is cruicial if I'm going to improve.

#####Positioning is also hard

Aside from that, positioning each element was very difficult. When I thought something was working, I'd continue my work and discover that I hadn't quite fixed the issues. When that didn't happen, I discovered that they were only positioned accurately on the Virtual Machine's browser, and didn't work *exactly* like that outside of the VM.

After studying official Google pages (as comparison) while I was working, I noticed some things were placed inside of containers elsewhere, and positioned relative to that one thing, instead of having its own, specific, container. This opened my eyes to more intuitive ways of positioning, and something I'll be trying out frequently in the future.

#####I have no idea how to structure CSS files

The more I added to styles.css, the more I realised that I have no idea how to structure things inside of it. By the end of the project, I'd been simply remembering where each rule was instead of intuitively being able to figure it out. Something I need to look up for the next project, as it's not an issue I want persisting.

In addition, I wasn't making the best use of nesting. I could have probably neatened the file up simply by organising the rules better like that. In other words, I'm aware that I should have organised the classes better and had avoided creating unnecessary classes (e.g. nav-bl instead of nav). I could have achieved similar functionality in more intuitive ways, I'm sure. This is something I need to test for myself, though, since I'm honestly not sure if what I'm thinking would even *work*.

#####The importance of using the correct elements

Most notably would be me avoiding elements simply because of not having enough information to feel like I'm *properly* utilising it, instead substituing in an element I wouldn't have simply because it's nicer for what I needed it for, instead of what it *would* have been used for had it been a fully-functioning website. Some of this came down to not having any JavaScript knowledge, so I couldn't add that layer of functionality despite wanting to.

#####Summary

While the project took much longer than it should have, since I didn't have as much time as I wanted to have to actually work on it, I do feel as though I learnt a lot from this project and have a sufficient understanding to undertake more complex projects or experiment more thoroughly with what I *have* learnt.
