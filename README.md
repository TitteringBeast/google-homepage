A project set by The Odin Project, with the objective of deconstructing an pre-existing webpage and rebuilding it. This is to give myself some experience setting up a webpage and get a better idea of how they should be set up and styled.

At the end of the project, I'll update this README file with a list of what I accomplished, learnt, and perhaps what hurdles I encountered along the way.
